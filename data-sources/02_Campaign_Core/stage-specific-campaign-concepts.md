## STAGE 1: EARLY ADOPTERS - "Smart Home Survivor Stories"

### Campaign Concept 1: "11 Apps vs 1 Conversation"

**Content Framework:**

**Opening Hook (0-3 seconds):**

- "$10K invested, but feels more complicated than before"

**Solution Demonstration (15-45 seconds):**
- Natural conversation with HeyZack orchestrating entire home
- "Hey Zack, we're watching a movie" → lights dim, TV turns on, temperature adjusts
- "Hey Zack, goodnight" → everything shuts down, security activates
