HeyZack Business Model Canvas
Executive Summary
HeyZack operates as an AI-powered smart home automation platform targeting the underserved mid-market premium segment between DIY solutions ($200-$800) and luxury professional installations ($14,000+). The company delivers a comprehensive 11-device kit with proprietary AI orchestration technology that transforms existing smart home investments into unified, intelligent systems.
The dual-market approach serves both residential customers through a B2B2C model with certified installers (€30/month starting) and commercial buildings through direct B2B sales (€150,000+ implementations). Key differentiators include "Intelligent Guardian" positioning versus competitors' "Friend/Assistant" approach, proactive AI orchestration versus reactive automation, and professional-grade features without professional installation requirements.
Revenue streams include hardware sales ($399-$999 residential, €150,000+ commercial), subscription services, and installation partnerships. The business model leverages AI technology as a core competitive advantage while addressing the critical pain point of smart home fragmentation fatigue experienced by tech-savvy professionals with existing investments.
