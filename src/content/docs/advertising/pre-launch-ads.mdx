## Email Pre-Launch Sequences

### Email 1: Problem Awareness (Welcome)

**Subject:** "Your $3,000 smart home investment is failing you"

**Preview:** "Here's why most smart homes create more problems..."

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

You invested in smart home technology to simplify your life.

Instead, you got:
‚ùå 8+ different apps to manage  
‚ùå Devices that don't talk to each other  
‚ùå Routines that break randomly  
‚ùå Commands you have to memorize

You're not alone. 73% of smart home owners report daily frustrations with their systems.

The problem? Current "smart" homes aren't actually intelligent.

They're collections of devices pretending to be a system.

But what if your home had real intelligence? An AI companion that learned your life and anticipated your needs?

That's exactly what we're building.
