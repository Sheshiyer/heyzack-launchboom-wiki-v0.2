## üìÖ Email Sequence Timeline

### 4 Weeks Before Launch

**Email 1: Problem Introduction**
```
Subject: The $2.7 billion package theft problem

Hi [First Name],

Every year, 2.7 billion packages are stolen from doorsteps across America. That's 7.4 million packages every single day.

If you've ever had a package stolen, you know that sinking feeling when you come home to find... nothing.

But what if I told you there's a simple solution that could end package theft forever?

Over the next few weeks, I'll be sharing the story of how we're solving this massive problem with breakthrough AI technology.

Stay tuned,
[Your Name]

P.S. Reply and let me know - have you ever had a package stolen?
```

**Email 2: Founder Story (3 days later)**
```
Subject: Why I spent 2 years building this...

Hi [First Name],

Two years ago, my wife's birthday present was stolen right off our doorstep.

A $300 necklace I'd saved up for months to buy. Gone.

The worst part? Our "smart" doorbell didn't even alert us. It was too busy sending notifications about leaves blowing in the wind.

That night, I decided to build something better. Something that could actually tell the difference between a delivery driver and a thief.

After 24 months of development, countless prototypes, and over $100,000 invested, we finally cracked the code.

I can't wait to show you what we've built.

[Your Name]

P.S. What's the most expensive thing you've had stolen? Hit reply and let me know.
```

### 3 Weeks Before Launch

**Email 3: Solution Teaser**
```
Subject: The AI that never sleeps

Hi [First Name],

Imagine having a security guard who:
- Never takes breaks
- Never gets distracted
- Can tell the difference between your neighbor and a stranger
- Costs less than a monthly coffee subscription

That's exactly what we've built.

Our breakthrough AI technology has been trained on over 10 million images to recognize people, packages, vehicles, and potential threats with 99.7% accuracy.

No more false alarms. No more missed deliveries. No more worrying about what's happening at your front door.

We're launching on Kickstarter in 3 weeks, and I wanted you to be among the first to know.

Excited to share more soon,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 4: Behind the Scenes (4 days later)**
```
Subject: [PHOTOS] Inside our testing lab

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to give you a sneak peek inside our testing facility where we've been perfecting our AI detection technology.

[Include 2-3 photos of the lab, team working, testing setup]

Over the past 18 months, we've run over 50,000 detection tests to ensure our AI can distinguish between:
- Family members vs. strangers
- Delivery drivers vs. potential threats  
- Packages vs. other objects
- Day vs. night scenarios

The results have been incredible - 99.7% accuracy across all test scenarios.

But the real test will be in your home, protecting your family and packages.

Launch is just 2.5 weeks away!

[Your Name]
```

### 2 Weeks Before Launch

**Email 5: Feature Reveal #1**
```
Subject: See this in action (30-second video)

Hi [First Name],

Actions speak louder than words, so I wanted to show you our AI detection in action.

[Embed 30-second demo video]

Watch how our system:
1. Detects the delivery driver approaching
2. Recognizes the package in their hands
3. Sends an instant, relevant notification
4. Ignores the neighbor's cat walking by

This is the difference between smart technology and spam notifications.

Launching in exactly 2 weeks!

[Your Name]

P.S. What feature are you most excited about? Hit reply and let me know!

**Email 6: Social Proof (3 days later)**
```
Subject: "This caught my package thief red-handed"

Hi [First Name],

Beta tester Sarah from Denver sent me this message yesterday:

"Your doorbell caught a package thief in the act and helped police recover $500 worth of stolen goods from my neighbors too. This thing is incredible!"

Sarah is one of 50 beta testers who've been using our smart doorbell for the past 3 months.

Here's what they're saying:

‚úÖ "Finally, a doorbell that doesn't cry wolf" - Mike T.
‚úÖ "Saved me from 3 missed deliveries this week" - Jennifer L.  
‚úÖ "Installation took 10 minutes, works perfectly" - David R.
‚úÖ "My kids love talking to grandma through the doorbell" - Lisa M.

Beta testing ends next week when we launch on Kickstarter.

## üéØ Email Best Practices

### Subject Line Optimization
- **Curiosity-driven:** "The $2.7 billion problem"
- **Personal:** "Why I spent 2 years building this"
- **Urgency:** "48 hours to go"
- **Benefit-focused:** "Never miss another delivery"
- **Social proof:** "This caught my package thief"

### Content Guidelines
- **Personal tone:** Write like you're talking to a friend
- **Story-driven:** Every email should advance the narrative
- **Value-first:** Always provide value before asking
- **Mobile-optimized:** Short paragraphs, scannable format
- **Clear CTA:** One primary action per email

### Timing Strategy
- **Consistent schedule:** Same day/time each week
- **Optimal send times:** Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM - 2 PM
- **Frequency:** 2-3 emails per week maximum
- **Launch day:** Send early morning in subscriber's timezone

---

## üìä Performance Tracking

### Key Metrics
- **Open Rate:** Target 25-35% for engaged list
- **Click Rate:** Target 3-7% depending on email type
- **List Growth:** Track new subscribers from each email
- **Unsubscribe Rate:** Keep under 2% per email
- **Launch Conversion:** % of email list that backs on day 1

### A/B Testing Elements
- **Subject lines:** Test curiosity vs. benefit vs. urgency
- **Send times:** Test different days and times
- **Email length:** Short vs. long form content
- **CTA placement:** Top vs. bottom vs. multiple
