## üîí Security-Focused Messaging

### Core Value Propositions

#### 1. Intelligent Protection
```
"Your home deserves smart security, not spam notifications."

Traditional security cameras alert you to everything:
‚ùå Leaves blowing in wind
‚ùå Cars driving by
‚ùå Shadows moving
‚ùå Your own family

HeyZack's AI learns what matters:
‚úÖ Unknown person approaches
‚úÖ Package deliveries
‚úÖ Suspicious activity
‚úÖ Actual security threats

Smart protection. Real peace of mind.
```

#### 2. Family Safety First
```
"Know your family is safe, even when you're not home."

‚úÖ See when kids arrive from school
‚úÖ Verify visitors before they enter
‚úÖ Deter package thieves and intruders
‚úÖ Two-way communication from anywhere
‚úÖ Instant alerts that actually matter

Because your family's safety isn't negotiable.
```

#### 3. Privacy & Control
```
"Your security. Your data. Your control."

üîê Local storage options (no cloud required)
üîê End-to-end encryption
üîê No monthly fees or subscriptions
üîê You own your data
üîê Works without internet (local features)

Security shouldn't compromise your privacy.
```
