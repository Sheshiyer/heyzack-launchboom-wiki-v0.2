## 🚀 Launch Week Emails

### Day 1: Launch Announcement
```
Subject: 🚀 WE'RE LIVE! (Early bird 40% off - limited time)

Hi [First Name],

The moment we've all been waiting for is finally here!

HeyZack Smart Doorbell is officially live on Kickstarter, and the response has been incredible.

✅ 127 backers in the first 3 hours
✅ $11,430 raised (38% of our goal already!)
✅ Featured on Kickstarter's "Projects We Love"

[CTA Button: Get Your HeyZack Now - 40% Off]

But here's the thing - our early bird pricing of $89 (40% off retail) is only available to the first 500 backers.

We're already at 127, which means only 373 spots left at this incredible price.

After that, pricing goes to $99, then $109, then full retail price of $149.

Don't miss out on the best deal we'll ever offer:

## 📈 Mid-Campaign Emails

### Week 2: Feature Spotlight
```
Subject: The AI feature that changes everything

Hi [First Name],

One of our backers, Jennifer from Austin, sent me this message yesterday:

"I was skeptical about the AI detection, but it's incredible. It knows the difference between my kids coming home and strangers approaching. No more false alarms!"

This is exactly why we spent 18 months perfecting our AI technology.

Traditional doorbells spam you with notifications:
❌ Leaves blowing in the wind
❌ Cars driving by
❌ Shadows moving
❌ Your own family members

HeyZack's AI learns your patterns and only alerts you when it matters:
✅ Unknown person approaches
✅ Package delivery arrives
✅ Suspicious activity detected
✅ Someone rings the doorbell

[Watch 60-second AI demo video]

This is the difference between smart technology and spam notifications.

We're now at $43,200 raised (144% funded) with 19 days to go!

Join 573 smart backers who chose intelligence over interruption:

### Week 2: Behind the Scenes
```
Subject: [PHOTOS] Inside our manufacturing facility

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to give you an exclusive look at where your HeyZack doorbell will be made!

[Include 3-4 photos of manufacturing facility, quality control, team]

I just got back from visiting our manufacturing partner in Taiwan, and I'm blown away by their attention to detail.

Every single unit goes through:
✅ 12-point quality inspection
✅ Weather resistance testing
✅ AI calibration verification
✅ App connectivity testing

We're not cutting corners on quality - your HeyZack will be built to last.

Production timeline update:
📅 March: Final design approval
📅 April: Tooling and setup
📅 May: Production begins
📅 June: Quality testing
📅 July: Shipping to backers

We're on track for July delivery!

Current campaign stats:
🎯 $47,890 raised (160% funded)
🎯 634 backers
🎯 17 days remaining

Still time to join the revolution:

### Week 3: Social Proof
```

💬 "Backed immediately after seeing the AI demo. Can't wait to get mine!" - Sarah L.
